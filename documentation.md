# Development Notes (to-do list)
- Create "blueprint" object that sits in front of player. Make this a ramp to reach higher points
- Create an object clone (if no intersections) in position of blueprint, that has collision
- Use these platforms to collect items for points, and reach a goal (need all items collected)
- Limit number of possible creations based on how many are needed to complete the level
- Get a player asset
- Get some audio bits (footsteps, item pickup,platform placed)
Process:
- Create collectible script
- Adjust player collision to pick them up and adjust the on-screen var
